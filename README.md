lpl-processor
=============

Processing sketch for converting regular videos into light painting videos. Probably doesn't require any previous experience with code. It's very simple.

- Download the Processing IDE from https://processing.org/
- Put your movie into `lpl_processor/data/`
- In the code, edit the `moviePath`, `WIDTH`, and `HEIGHT` to match your input.
- Run the script, and wait until it finishes. 
- The composited frames will be in `output/`. Use the Processing > Tools > Movie Maker utility to create the final movie.
